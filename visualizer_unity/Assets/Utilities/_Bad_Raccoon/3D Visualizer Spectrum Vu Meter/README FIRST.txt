Please, a small review/and stars rating should be really appreciated :) 


						----------------------------------------
						Here is some tips, how to setup etc... :
						----------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
First to do (before importing package) : IMPORTANT
--------------------------------------------------

- Create a new project.
- Download this package on the asset store : http://u3d.as/KTp and import it.
- Import the raccoon package.
- Load the examples scenes.
- Add a component to each scenes camera : Add Component => Effects => Post-Processing Behavior
- And into the inspector of this new component drop the file : Post-Processing Profile
- Prepare to be blind! :)

----------------
Why this shit? :
----------------
Because include the effects package, generate always problems when unity is updated...

-----------
IMPORTANT :
-----------

If you want to import multiple visualizers into a scene, only get the volume of 
one of them to 1, for the others put the same music, but set the volume to zero! 


-------------------------------------------
What is the file : Post-Processing Profile?
-------------------------------------------
This file is the file to use with the new unity post process stack.
